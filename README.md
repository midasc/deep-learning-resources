# deep-learning-resources
A Collection of resources I have found useful on my journey finding my way through the world of Deep Learning.

Don't get too hang-up on the perfect road map to Deep Learning Mastery - take something that looks interesting, and get stuck in.


## Courses
[Stanford CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual
Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/)

[Coursera: Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks)

Even though Deep Learning is a small but important subset of Machine Learning, it is still important to get a wider knowledge and understanding of Machine Learning and no course will give you a better understanding than the excellent course by Andrew Ng.

[Coursera: Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

The fast.ai team promises to take you to the cool stuff asap.

## Getting Philosophical
[What is the next likely breakthrough in Deep
Learning](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-likely-breakthrough-in-Deep-Learning-1)

Looking at [The major advancements in Deep Learning in
2016](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2016/12/06/major-advancements-deep-learning-2016/) gives us a peek into the future of
deep learing. A big portion of the effort went into Generative Models, let us see if that is the case in 2017.

[Do machines actually beat doctors?](https://lukeoakdenrayner.wordpress.com/2016/11/27/do-computers-already-outperform-doctors/)

Visualising a Neural Network as a tree with branches and using smart pruning techniques might be the answer to

## Tools of the Trade
### Python
[Python Official](https://www.python.org/)

[Python Programming Tutorials](https://pythonprogramming.net/)

### MatplotLib
Deep Learning is far from being an exact science and a lot of what you do is based on getting a feel for the underlying mechanics, visualising the moving parts makes it easier to understand and Matplotlib is the go-to library for visualisation

[Matplotlib official](http://matplotlib.org)

[Matplotlib tutorial](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/matplotlib/)

[YouTube: Bare Minimum: Matplotlib for data visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZthnIfAbKAU)


### NumPy
NumPy is a fast optimized package for scientific computing, and is also the underlying library a lot of Machine Learning frameworks are build on top of. Becoming a NumPy ninja is an important step to mastery.

[NumPy official](http://www.numpy.org)

[CS231n Python Numpy Tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)

[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/rasbt/deep-learning-book/blob/master/code/appendix_f_numpy-intro/appendix_f_numpy-intro.ipynb)


### TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. TensorFlow is designed and highly optimised to take
advantage of GPU technology in a distributed manner not only on a single instance with many GPU's, but also across many devices and networks, making 
it an ideal framework for learning and production.
